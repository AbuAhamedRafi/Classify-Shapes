## TensorFlow Integration

### How TensorFlow Models are Used

In Claasify, TensorFlow models are utilized to enhance the data classification process. The models are trained to recognize patterns and categorize data accurately.

### Implementation

1. **Model Training**: TensorFlow models are trained using a dataset relevant to the classification tasks. The training process involves feeding the data into the model and adjusting the parameters to minimize the error.

2. **Model Integration**: The trained TensorFlow models are integrated into the React application using TensorFlow.js. This allows the models to run directly in the browser, providing real-time classification without the need for a backend server.

3. **Data Processing**: When a user inputs data, it is preprocessed and fed into the TensorFlow model. The model then outputs the classification results, which are displayed to the user.

### How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user inputs data through the application interface.
2. **Preprocessing**: The input data is preprocessed to match the format expected by the TensorFlow model.
3. **Model Prediction**: The preprocessed data is passed to the TensorFlow model, which generates a prediction.
4. **Result Display**: The classification results are displayed to the user in an intuitive and easy-to-understand format.

By leveraging TensorFlow models, Claasify provides accurate and efficient data classification, enhancing the overall user experience.
